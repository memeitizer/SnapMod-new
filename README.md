# How To Use

To use this Xposed module, you'll need a rooted or a non-rooted phone (ðŸ˜±). 

## For both
* Please install a supported Snapchat version ([APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/snap-inc/snapchat/snapchat-12-26-0-20-release/snapchat-12-26-0-20-2-android-apk-download/) for example), currently the supported one is **12.26.0.20** for SnapMod 1.8.8. We do not offer official (You might get in GitHub issues) support for versions that are behind either one.
* > **Note** If you are an android developer or something similar, you can create mappings yourself that might work for higher/lower Snapchat versions. You can follow the steps in `.github/workflows`
* > **Note** If you have obtained custom mappings, move them in `/(Android|data)/data/xyz.rodit.snapmod/files/[build].json`. Build numbers you can obtain from APKMirror, if they are not provided. With a good file explorer (Like MiXplorer or File Manager Plus) non-rooted users can do this as well.

* > **Warning** We might not offer support for non-rooted users

# Issues
> **Warning** Please do not create duplicate issues. Refrain from creating feature requests or common questions in our Issues or use **Telegram group** for these.

## Troubleshooting
If nothing works, the first thing to do is: kill the Snapchat app process through system settings and after that relaunch it and do this twice. This will make sure any cached mappings are updated.

## GitHub Issues
If you have encountered an issue: First check Github Issues if others have experienced it if not, please get logs from LSPosed and upload them while creating a new issue. Please describe the bug, give us steps to reproduce, screenshots, expected behaviour and any additional context you might have.
